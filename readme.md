# The Quest
This is a text-based DnD-styled game that is inspired by a web browser based text rpg game with dnd elements in the past, otherwise known as Vagabond's Quest.  
 
The intention is to re-create a similar yet different game, with the technologies currently available. This acts as a benefit for me to learn how to program in Golang as well.  
 
Currently still a WIP project with many concepts not clearly fleshed out.
